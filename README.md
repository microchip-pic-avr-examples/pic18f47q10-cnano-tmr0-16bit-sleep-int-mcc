# Timer0 in 16-bit Mode with Periodic Interrupt using the PIC18F47Q10 Microcontroller with MCC Melody


## Objective
This repository contains an example of MCC Melody generated source code for Timer0 (TMR0) as described in [*TB3285 - Getting Started with Timers/Counters on PIC18*](https://www.microchip.com/wwwappnotes/appnotes.aspx?appnote=en1003329) document from Microchip. This example describes how to configure TMR0 in 16-bit mode and generate an overflow interrupt every ten seconds, using the LFINTOSC as clock source. TMR0 will run while the microcontroller is in Sleep mode.

<br>A GPIO pin (the development board’s on-board LED) will be configured as output and when the interrupt occurs, the microcontroller is woken up, the LED is lit for 100 ms and then the microcontroller is put back in Sleep mode.

<br>The code was generated using MPLAB® Code Configurator.

## Operation

To program the Curiosity Nano board with this MPLAB® X project, follow the steps provided in the [How to Program the Curiosity Nano Board](#how-to-program-the-curiosity-nano-board) chapter.<br><br>


## 1. Setup
The following peripheral and clock configurations are set up using MCC Melody for the PIC18F47Q10: 

- Clock Control:
  - Clock Source: HFINTOSC
  - HF Internal Clock: 1 MHz
  - Clock Divider: 1

- TMR0:
  - Enable Timer: Enable
  - Clock Prescaler: 1:32
  - Postscaler: 1:1
  - Timer Mode: 16-bit
  - Clock Source: LFINTOSC
  - Enable Synchronization: Disabled
  - Requested Period (s): 10 seconds
  - TMR Interrupt: Enabled

Configuration Bits:
- CONFIG3L:
  - WDT Operating Mode: WDT Disabled
- CONFIG4H:
  - Low Voltage Programming Enable: Enabled
<br><img src="images/configuration-bits-mcc.png" width="600">

The following pin configuration must be made for this project:


|  Pin  |    Configuration    |      Function       |
| :---: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: |
|  RE0  | Digital Output      | LED0                |


## 2. Demo

In this demo, it is represented how the TMR0 intterupt is working when the microcontroller is in the sleep mode. The on-board LED toggles once in 10 seconds in order to show how the timer interrupt wakes up the microcontroller.
